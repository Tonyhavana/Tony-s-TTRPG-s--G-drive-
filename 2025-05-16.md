Today Michael helped me set up a repository on Github and helped me learn how to sync my obsidian vault from my desktop to my iPhone.  Now I need to practice what he taught me by setting it up on my iPad!  He also demoed for me all the things you can do in Obsidian, how it works, and how templates work and can be used to make prep and ttrpg info management easier and manageable.  In true hero's journey form, the student has become the master and he is now teaching the teacher that which is new.  Today filled me with such pride and love; words are weak tools to convey the feeling.  I hope he gets to experience this joy for himself one day.
